What readers on Amazon have to say:

> The author does a great job explaining the concepts needed to understand what's happening in the application without 
> the need of going into too many details. <br/>
&ndash; [Sebastian Montabone](http://www.samontab.com)

> Excellent book to build practical OpenCV projects! I'm still relatively new to OpenCV, but all examples are well 
> laid out and easy to follow. The author does a good job explaining the concepts in detail and shows how they apply 
> in real life. As a professional programmer, I especially love that you can just fork the code from GitHub and follow 
> along. Strongly recommend to readers with basic knowledge of computer vision, machine learning, and Python!
&ndash; Amazon Customer

> Usually I'm not a big fan of technical books because they are too dull, but this one is written in an engaging 
> manner with a few dry jokes here and there. Can only recommend! <br/>

## Software Requirements
All projects can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux, and require the following software packages:
* OpenCV 2.4.9 or later: Recent 32-bit and 64-bit versions as well as installation instructions are available at
http://opencv.org/downloads.html. Platform-specific installation instructions can be found at
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html.
* Python 2.7 or later: Recent 32-bit and 64-bit installers are available at https://www.python.org/downloads. The
installation instructions can be found at https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download.
* NumPy 1.9.2 or later: This package for scientific computing officially comes in 32-bit format only, and can be
obtained from http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html. The installation instructions can be found at 
http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/index.html#building.
* wxPython 2.8 or later: This GUI programming toolkit can be obtained from http://www.wxpython.org/download.php.
Its installation instructions are given at http://wxpython.org/builddoc.php.

In addition, some chapters require the following free Python modules:
* SciPy 0.16.0 or later (Chapter 1): This scientific Python library officially comes in 32-bit only, and can be obtained
from http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html. The installation instructions can be found at
http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/index.html#building.
* matplotlib 1.4.3 or later (Chapters 4 to 7): This 2D plotting library can be obtained from
http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html. Its installation instructions can be found by going to
http://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html#how-to-install.
* libfreenect 0.5.2 or later (Chapter 2): The libfreenect module by the OpenKinect project (http://www.openkinect.org)
provides drivers and libraries for the Microsoft Kinect hardware, and can be obtained from
https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect. Its installation instructions can be found at
http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started.

Furthermore, the use of iPython (http://ipython.org/install.html) is highly recommended as it provides a flexible,
interactive console interface.
